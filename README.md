## Coding style
### Includes 
Includes will be grouped and groupes will be ordere by this logic. Includes will also be ordered alphabetically inside
these groups.
- File header (Header file corresponding to the current source file)
- Arduino std
- Arduino libraries
- Project includes

External includes (files that are not in repository) will be included with `<>`  
Internal includes (files inside the repository) will be included with `""`
