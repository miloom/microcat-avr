## Coding style
### Includes 
Includes will be grouped and groupes will be ordere by this logic. Includes will also be ordered alphabetically inside
these groups.
- File header (Header file corresponding to the current source file)
- Arduino std
- Arduino libraries
- Project includes

External includes (files that are not in repository) will be included with `<>`  
Internal includes (files inside the repository) will be included with `""`

## Protobuf
This project uses nanopb as protobuf implementation because it's implemented in C and allows embedded devices to use it.

To setup protouf generation locally you have to install protobuf compiler:
```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler -y
```
Next you need to install python3 dependecies with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Command to generate the protobuf files correctly:
```bash
python3 src/nanopb/generator/nanopb_generator.py proto/*.proto -L '#include "../nanopb/%s"' -I ./proto -D src/autogenerated/ -C
```
